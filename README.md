## How to convert data to the standard we use – Akoma Ntoso

Akoma Ntoso1 is a comprehensive XML schema for several Parliamentary document types such as bills, acts, and debates. Various bodies around the world are starting to use or interoperate with Akoma Ntoso to model their data. Whilst it was designed for Parliamentary document types, the schema is general enough that it can be used for many different types of debate.

SayIt can import a subset of Akoma Ntoso, and below we describe which aspects of it we currently cover. You can export an Akoma Ntoso representation of any section on SayIt by adding .an to the end of any section URI, for example Shakespeare’s The Tempest: https://shakespeare.sayit.mysociety.org/the-tempest.an.
