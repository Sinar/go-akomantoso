                <from>Mr. Kappa</from>
                <p>asked the Minister for Education and
                    Sports the organic relations between the BUNGENI National Association
                    of Teachers (BNAT) and the International Association of Graduate Teachers
                    (IAGRAT) in pursuance of the professional and trade union rights of
                    teachers in the country and trade union rights of teachers in the
                    country, because the two are not the same. And in his Answer, he
                    referred to professional rights of both members. Does it mean that
                    the IAGRAT has no trade union rights as his Answer states? Because,
                    the two are not the same. Professional rights are different from
                    trade</p>

                <p>Mr. Speaker, BNAT was the only umbrella professional body for
                    teachers in the country until when some graduate teachers started
                    agitation for recognition and finally broke away and formed the
                    National Association of Graduate Teachers (NAGRAT). </p>
                <p> Currently, there are two (2) associations serving the interest of
                    teachers in the BES<noteRef href="#not01" marker="1"/>.
                    Whereas members of IAGRAT consist of a section
                    of graduate teachers, BNATcovers nongraduates as well as graduate teachers.</p>
                <p> The professional rights of both members of BNAT and IAGRAT are
                    assured as outlined in the Conditions and Scheme of Service for
                    teachers. In the event, where a member of the Service has a problem,
                    he approaches the association to which he belongs and that
                    association handles the problem with BES in the light of the
                    Conditions of Service.</p>
                <p> In the area of professional development, BNAT organizes in-service
                    training for its members.</p>
                <p> Mr. Speaker, BNAT joins the ‘FORUM’ comprising the Judicial Service
                    Staff Association of BUNGENI (JUSSAB), the Registered Nurses
                    Association (BRNA) and the Civil Servants Association (CSA) for the
                    negotiation of salaries for all teachers.</p>
